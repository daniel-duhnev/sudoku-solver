Feel free to explore all the files in this folder.
Their labelling corresponds to my thought process, trial and error, and beta sudoku solver function attempts.
You may notice that sometimes I have included extra information in the form of comments and text blocks as to what I am aiming to achieve. Other times I have been exploring different manipulations that I didn't end up using or have just left it out from excitement to make progress on this project. In all cases feel free to explore and raise any questions with me. I'd be happy to try and dig into this mess with you and come out with peace and clarity (and maybe a comment or two)..
