    "An example of an easy level sudoku is given below. I have linked the website where I got this puzzle from.\n",

    "An example of a medium and expert level sudokus are also given in the last cells. You will notice that if you run them, the kernel will sooner or later crash. This is because that puzzle is not solvable with this algorithm. For that we will have to explore later versions (version 3 and beyond) that add a few tricks in our bag.\n",

A simple way to \"find\" the boarders of the board and split it into 81 images, would be to symmetrically split the image in 9x9 equal images. This would assume that the edges of the board are perfectly at the edges of the image.\n",
